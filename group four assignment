In this program we implemented Object Oriented Programming in C++ using a base class Vehicle and two derived classes Car and Motorbike.
The Vehicle class stores the common attributes brand and model and also contains a static variable count to track the total number of vehicles created.
Each vehicle updates this static count when it is constructed.
The derived classes extend Vehicle by adding unique features such as seats for cars and engine capacity for motorbikes.
Polymorphism is demonstrated because we stored different objects inside a Vehicle pointer array and called displayInfo() using a loop.
We also used a global variable called companyName and a local variable inside updateModel() to temporarily store a new model name.
File handling is used to write all vehicle data to a text file and then read the contents back and display them.
We also included exception handling to manage invalid values such as negative seats or negative engine capacity.
This program therefore demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, static variables, local variables, global variables and exception handling.
Overall the code fulfills all the assignment objectives using correct object oriented programming principles in C++.
